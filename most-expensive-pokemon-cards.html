According to Dexterto and Dicebreaker, these cards are worth a lot of money, and some of them have reached all-time high values in TCG history.</p><p>The game and its cards received a renewed spike of popularity in 2021, resulting in the cards’ value rising to far over hundreds of dollars. These were formerly valued nearly nothing, but have since been sold and auctioned for astronomical sums. In fact, many of them are among the most expensive cards on the market.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> 1999 First Edition Shadowless Holographic Charizard</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> 1999 Secret Super Battle No. 1 Trainer</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> 2000 Pokémon Neo Genesis 1st Edition Holo Lugia</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> 2006 Pokémon World Championships Promo No. 2 Trainer</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Black Star Ishihara Signed GX Promo Card</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Illustrator CoroCoro Comics Promo Pikachu Illustrator Card</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Kangaskhan-Holo #115 Family Event Trophy Card</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Pokémon Blastoise #009/165R Commissioned Presentation Galaxy Star Hologram</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Tamamushi University Magikarp Trophy Promo</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Umbreon Gold Star Holo</a></li></ul><h3><span id=1999_First_Edition_Shadowless_Holographic_Charizard>1999 First Edition Shadowless Holographic Charizard</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1999-First-Edition-Shadowless-Holographic-Charizard-4.jpg alt width=740 height=370 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>With a price tag of $420,000, this Shadowless Holographic Charizard is the second most expensive Pokémon card ever. It was sold in March 2022, and its crowning beauty, aside from being a first edition card, was the lack of a shadow beneath Charizard, which was later addressed.</p><p>The card has a PSA Grade of Gem Mint 10 and is one of the hottest commodities in the TCG market, despite being almost two decades old.</p><h3><span id=1999_Secret_Super_Battle_No_1_Trainer>1999 Secret Super Battle No. 1 Trainer</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1999-Secret-Super-Battle-No.-1-Trainer.jpg alt width=740 height=370 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The 1999 Super Secret Battle No. 1 Trainer card was sold for a whopping $90,000 in July 2020.

This earned it the high price it was purchased for, and it remains one of the most elusive and sought-after cards in the TCG.</p><h3><span id=2006_Pokemon_World_Championships_Promo_No_2_Trainer>2006 Pokémon World Championships Promo No. 2 Trainer</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2006-Pokemon-World-Championships-Promo-No.-2-Trainer.jpg alt width=740 height=370 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>This prized card was only given to the champions of the 2006 Pokémon World Championships, and there are only three of them in existence.

This card was created for the winners of the Japanese magazine CoroCoro Comic’s competitions in 1997 and 1998.</p><p>In this card, the word “trainer” has been replaced by “Illustrator,” and unlike any other card, it features a pen icon at the bottom. This is the most precious Pokémon card, with only 40 or so copies in existence.</p><h3><span id=Kangaskhan-Holo_115_Family_Event_Trophy_Card>Kangaskhan-Holo #115 Family Event Trophy Card</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kangaskhan-Holo-115-Family-Event-Trophy-Card.jpg alt width=740 height=370 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Because it portrays the lovely Kangaskhan and its baby, it was awarded at the 1998 Parent/Child Mega Battle event, where a parent and their child were intended to battle together.</p><p>It has the Japanese logo from the original Pocket Monsters Card Game as well as a rare holographic Pokémon.

Only two of these cards exist, with one appearing in 2021 and selling for $360,000 in January of that year.</p><p>One of the two cards made had a Magic: The Gathering back, but the one that sold had a blank back, making it even more unusual than usual.</p><h3><span id=Tamamushi_University_Magikarp_Trophy_Promo>Tamamushi University Magikarp Trophy Promo</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Tamamushi-University-Magikarp-Trophy-Promo.jpg alt width=740 height=370 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>This extremely uncommon card has a fascinating backstory.

The Umbreon Gold Star Holo is one of just two cards with a BGS rating of 9.5 in the world, making it even more precious.</p><p>To obtain the coveted card in the TCG, players had to earn almost 70,000 XP points. It sold for $70,000 at auction, and there are only a few of these 2005 cards left in the world.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
