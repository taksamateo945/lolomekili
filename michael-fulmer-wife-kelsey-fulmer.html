A few weeks before Vegas, Michael participated in a Miracle League baseball game for special needs children. Kelsey shared on social media how proud she is of him. Kelsey manages to get to the gym in between travel and baseball. Now that the season ended, she can do more. When I say more, I mean anything besides going to downtown Detroit for baseball.</p><p>In March, Michael Fulmer’s wife wished him a happy birthday. She stayed in Florida at the time to watch preseason. They&nbsp;will likely go back to Florida or somewhere warm now that the season is over. If you live in the Detroit area in the offseason, you don’t come to expect cheery winters. Kelsey loves Bora Bora as a vacation destination. Everyone loves this place. It’s top three for sports couple destinations. Cabo San Lucas is also in the top three. Kelsey posts pictures and comments about Bora Bora all the time. I don’t think they traveled there yet, but it’s her dream.</p><p>The couple own a Huskie dog named Miya. They got her as a puppy in 2012. Michael Fulmer’s wife deals with the distance between them during the season by hanging out with Miya and reminding herself to be thankful to have Michael. That’s what she said in a post, anyway. I added the part about their dog, but you’ve got to figure they hang out a lot since the dog lives there. Michael and Kelsey originally met in 2008, and they are approaching a ten year anniversary. Kelsey says she can’t believe it’s been so long. She uses a social media app that brings up past posts from years ago. She seems fascinated with how time passes. Before she knows it, Michael will be retired, and they will live in Bora Bora!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2O9ra3YnqmwoaaawG%2BvzqZmpqSSZLGmwNGooK1lpJ60pr7SaKSim5iWsq15xa6jpp2iYsSqssRmop6ko5rGbrLUpaSeql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
