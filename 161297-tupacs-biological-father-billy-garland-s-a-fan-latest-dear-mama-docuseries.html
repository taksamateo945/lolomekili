According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a></i>, Garland said the show's writer and producer Allen Hughes did not give him a detailed explanation of what the show was about.</p><p class=align-left>He also noted that he was never informed that the show was also about Tupac's mother Afeni. He said:</p>"After I saw the interview in the documentary, I was slightly disappointed… I didn’t like it, to be honest with you. I thought it was more about something else than about Tupac if you know what I’m saying."<p></p><h2>Tupac's father Billy Garland reveals he didn't like the rapper's song, <i>Dear Mama</i></h2><p class=align-left>Tupac's song <i>Dear Mama</i> praises present mothers and slams, absent fathers. Speaking about his son's 1995 hit, Billy Garland said he did not like the song at first because the lyrics tagged him as a coward and a dead man.</p><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The American Songwriter</a></i> reports that Garland said he later realised that his son had been lied to and didn't know him too well.</p>“At first, I was upset because I’m trying to see you. But then it hit me, for one, I ain’t dead and so you really didn’t know me. Because if you would have known me, you would have known that I wasn’t dead. So I knew there that someone had lied to him from that point. So later on when I found out that someone did lie to him, that song made perfectly good sense. I understood it totally.”<h2>Nota Baloyi under fire for suggesting AKA's parents Tony and Lynn Forbes are capitalising on rapper's death</h2><p class=align-left>In more <a href=#>entertainment</a> news, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that Nota Baloyi never stays away from drama and controversy.
