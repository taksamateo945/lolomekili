Hot New Hip Hop said today that many celebs have been adamant about their support of Joe Biden, including stars like Dave Bautista, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Legend</a>, Beyonce, and Lady Gaga.</p><p>However, not every artist, especially rappers, have shared the same vision for the future of American politics. As most know, hip-hop artists such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent</a>, Lil’ Pump, and Kanye West have all come out in favor of Trump at some point, either directly or indirectly.</p><p>Admittedly, <strong>50 Cent</strong> later backtracked on his comments against Joe Biden after he was put on blast by people like Chelsea Chandler, other rappers, and people on social media. In fact, Curtis Jackson, aka 50 Cent, has continued to poke fun at the 2020 election, particularly <strong>Lil Wayne</strong> and Eminem.</p><p>According to Hot New Hip Hop, 50 Cent shared a meme in which a black man was carrying a Confederate Flag whereas a white man was sporting a Black Lives Matter flag. 50 Cent captioned the photo with a remark in which he suggested Eminem was the white man and Lil’ Wayne was the black man.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHGxQmXH9ui/</p><p>50 Cent appeared to poke fun at the purported irony of the two rappers standing on completely separate sides of the political spectrum, despite their ethnic-socioeconomic status. Additionally, news recently came out saying that Eminem allowed the Joe Biden campaign to use his song, “Lose Yourself,” for this year’s election.</p><p>Of course, this all comes after Lil’ Wayne visited with the president regarding the proposed “Platinum Plan,” which would extend resources and funding to certain institutions in black communities across the United States.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHHIZt4nIo1/</p><p>As it was previously reported, the former NWA member, Ice Cube, was also a part of the plan. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Cube found himself sparking the wrath</a> of many celebrities and social media users after he revealed the Trump administration was the first group to reach out to him to get work done in black communities.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Ice Cube later appeared on Fox News where he said CNN actually canceled their scheduled interview with him because of his meeting with Jared Kushner.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGdlZXqksc2tZKygkaeytHnAZqSepZViurCvyqKloGWcnrluw8CypZ5llqS5rbvWoqWgZZiewG65xJ6roqaXYsSqwMdmq6GdXaW%2Fpr%2FInZynrF1pgnN9mGlm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
