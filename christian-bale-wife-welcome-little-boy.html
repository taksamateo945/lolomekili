The American Hustle actor and his wife just welcomed their second child together. There is no word on what the couple decided to name their newest addition, or even when he arrived. Of course, this information does not come as a shock to Bale’s fans, who have known for many years that he’s a very private man, and his wife is happy to be as private as he.</p><p>The couple already have one daughter, 9. Bale’s wife is a former model and makeup artist, and she set rumors off in March when she appeared at the Academy Awards with her husband and showed off her baby bump for the world to see. No one knew she was pregnant, and no one addressed the rumors. In fact, the Bale family has yet to announce they are pregnant or even acknowledge that Sibi was pregnant with their second child.</p><p>Since her walk along the red carpet at the Oscars, Sibi hasn’t bothered trying to hide her growing baby bump, but the notoriously private couple still said not a word about it. News comes that the couple welcomed their second child only because their rep confirmed that the news was true. No more information will be made available by Bale’s rep regarding the birth of the little boy.</p><p>In a world where most celebrities can’t pump a tank of gas after eating a burger without speculation that they must be expecting, it’s refreshing to see that the star and his wife were able to keep their news private and avoid a media frenzy regarding the baby’s birth. Of course, with so many other high-profile celebrity babies born the last few weeks, they were able to slip that one in there without it becoming such a big deal.</p><p>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for BFCA)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGqrc1mmZqklWLEqrLEZq6epJOkuqZ5y6KrraSVYq%2BwxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
