Nevertheless, give it a shot by clicking the “cog” icon next to the “Play” button under <strong>Vanguard</strong> and select the “Scan and Repair” option. Maybe you’ll get lucky.</p><p>However, it seems like you might have more luck fixing this issue if you simply restart your computer, reinstall the Battle.net launcher, or update your GPU driver. I’ve also heard some theorize that this could be caused by running additional apps in the background while playing <strong>Vanguard</strong>, so try shutting down pretty everything but <strong>Vanguard</strong> if you’re desperate for a fix.</p><h2 id=h-call-of-duty-vanguard-keeps-freezing-on-ps4>Call of Duty: Vanguard Keeps Freezing on PS4</h2><p>If you’re one of the many PS4 gamers just waiting to get their hands on a PS5, you may be disheartened to learn that <strong>Vanguard</strong> seems to have quite a few compatibility issues with Sony’s best-selling console.

While the most common audio issue with the game seems to be related to its “muffled” audio cues that make it very difficult to hear certain actions, it just seems like there’s generally something wrong with many of the game’s audio files.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOnJilpF2ks26w1K2wZq6Ro7S2rdGdZKGnp2LBsHnFoq9mrJiaeq670q1knKedoryvecGunqxlkaOxbrPLoqucoJWofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
