I left the restaurant after an illiterate “manager “who knows nothing about managing a restaurant and handling of workers and what the rights of workers are, so the “manager” Named Mohammed abused me “Fuck You” three times’, the anonymous former staff wrote.</p><p>The staffer writes that he realized afterwards that the restaurant wasn’t remitting statutory deductions to the relevant authorities.</p><p>‘I was deducted NSSF, NHIF and PAYE from my salary, but later on, I realized that they were not remitted to the institutions’, he wrote.</p><p>Kulan is a toxic environment that has not contested the 21 incidences of slavery in its ranks as stated by another staff member below:</p><p>My friend who left employment there recently stated the below in 21 points:</p><li>Somali employees are treated differently from the other Kenyans.</li><li>Somali employees are bosses in their own right, they are in charge of every dept and a Somali must be present for anything to take place.</li><li>This is not so wrong if merit and experience were the criteria but not so.</li><li>A certified chef in the kitchen has to take instructions from Somali employees most who have no qualifications in culinary and some very little post-primary education. In short, a certified cook takes instructions from any Somali be it the cashier, store keeper or the kitchen supervisor all who are not chefs by any standard.</li><li>This is very unprofessional and a huge demotivator to serious professional.</li><li>Imagine having to follow an order from some whose rank is granted by ethnicity.</li><li>The waiters are in the same dilemma and so are the rest of Kenyan staff.</li><li>There is no disciplinary action against Somali misconduct.</li><li>They are frequently late and maybe abusive and aggressive towards other staff.</li><li>They have been cases of Kenyans facing abusive language and no action is taken.</li><li>Kenyans often resign due to frustration and abusive language.</li><li>The staff are employed on contract and thus dismissal is in the spot. The fight is your wits against the word of a Somali. As such the Kenyans fear the Somalis as they want to keep there Job.</li><li>There has been a case of a Somali staff hurling a knife as he didn’t like how he was served by fellow staff. This is how abbrasive things can be at Kulan.</li><li>The employer has no concern for staff welfare and consistently delays salary causing fights with landlords and caretakers. Pleas are not heeded</li><li>The owners also have a white friend by the name Nick who is known to be abusive to staff and smokes in the premises, causing discomfort to the staff</li><li>The Kenyan staff are provided for a meal of ugali, sukuma for lunch and tea and bread.</li><li>The Somali can, however, enjoy any meal from the menu at any time for free, this is another case of subtle discrimination. The staff can’t even have water from a glass, just tap water is allowed using plastic cups.</li><li>There NHIF and NSSF often go unpaid despite it being deducted and essential for healthcare. Lea is most likely not remitted (not sure).</li><li>This is just a snippet of what my friend who recently left narrated to me. More could be happening and I hope authorities investigate.</li><li>If you visit you will clearly see what I talk about, demotivated people in a toxic environment.</li><li>Please reach out to current and former staff and they will collaborate this.</li><p>Slavery In Kenya: <a href=#>Click to READ MORE</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifKzBy5qlZqqVqMGiwdGapa1llauupbHSZqeasZmjtG7AwLGcrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
