With her voice and guitar, Nadia wears her heart on her sleeve, telling her life story through music.</p><p>If Nadia looks familiar to you, it’s because she’s an actress too!&nbsp; She has been featured on shows like&nbsp;Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders, and Entourage.</p><p>With lyrics like, “I had this crazy dream / Oh it came so easily / Next thing I’m in the land of the free,” and “I don’t drink cold beer, only Starbucks,” Nadia Lanfranconi is a pure country girl, riding horses, climbing trees, wearing boots and a hat, topped with a beautiful sense of humor.</p><p>You can buy “Italian Country Song” on iTunes <a href=#><strong><span>HERE</span></strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Check out the music video for&nbsp;“Italian Country Song” below:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Connect with Nadia Lanfranconi:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Official Website</a>&nbsp;//&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;//&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;//&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a></p><p><strong>What did you think about Nadia’s music video for “Italian Country Song”?&nbsp;Let us know your thoughts on our&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a>!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ku6KwyJpkpZmem7%2BiusKopaJlopq5pq3SnqpmpaWotqR51aKbnqddm7yzecitmKWhkaN6pLvUp6ursV2ovK%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
