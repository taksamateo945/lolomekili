She had ruptured a blood vessel and was rapidly losing blood. “I thought I was going to die,” Shawna remembers. “I was so scared. I was freaking out. I thought, I gave this gift to my family and now I am going to bleed to death. One life in, one life out.”</p><p>Thankfully the crisis ended as quickly as it began, and Shawna was soon recovering. Despite the complications, Shawna tells Closer, “I would do it again in a heartbeat!”</p><p>“I’m glad we did it,” Lorenzo reveals to Closer. “Shawna wanted the experience of having a baby. I was glad that she got to do that — and that it wasn’t ours!”</p><p>“It’s complete closure for us,” explains Nik, who mourned with his wife over the son they lost in-utero last year. “It allows us to continue our legacy as a family.” Adds Shayne: “It was the biggest blessing in the world.”</p><p><b>For the full interview with the Lamas’ including why Shawna never wanted children of her own and all the exclusive pics of their new bundle of joy, pick up the latest issue of <i>Closer Weekly</i>, on newsstands now!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8WiqaysXaW1sMDOrGSsoJGuu6Z5y5qkmqtdo7asedGimqGhlWKvoq7YZpmosV1rg3eClA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
