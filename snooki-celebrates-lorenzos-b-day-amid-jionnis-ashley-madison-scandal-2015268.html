"So tomorrow is Christmas for Lorenzo. Can't believe my baby is 3!"</p><p>Her latest update was shared after <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong> discovered</a> on Monday, Aug. 24, that an email address belonging to LaValle matched one that was used on recently hacked cheaters' website Ashley Madison. Rather than addressing the report initially, Snooki went on her podcast Naturally Nicole on Tuesday and <a href=#>slammed <strong>Anna Duggar</strong></a> for staying with <strong>Josh Duggar </strong>after his cheating confession.</p><p>"And his wife is still standing by him!" the MTV reality star sniped on her podcast. "It's like, 'What the f–k is wrong with you? Like, what are you doing?' Yep, screw it."</p><p>Eventually, the mom to Lorenzo and 11-month-old daughter<strong> Giovanna</strong> felt that <a href=#>she had to address her husband's Ashley Madison talk</a> via social media.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"This morning when I got a call from my publicist that a story was going to be printed on my husband 'allegedly' signing up on Ashley Madison, I laughed — and said lets not even comment and give the story any juice, because it couldn't be any further from the truth," Polizzi captioned a pic from her November 2014 wedding. "Jionni is [one of] the most humble, respectful, and most loyal souls I know. I mean hello, that's why I married him… He's a stand up guy who loves his family more than anything in this world."</p><p>Polizzi then outright denied that her husband had accessed Ashley Madison. "No, my husband didn't sign up on that website to cheat on me," she wrote. "Honestly, if he wanted to cheat — he would go out and do it. Not sign up on a website and pay for it… Jionni is a good guy and doesn't need his name being tarnished."</p><p>In the wake of her defense, it still remains unclear who used LaValle's email account to subscribe to Ashley Madison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqnp5%2Bgtm6vxKWcm6qRqbK0ecuoqZ6mqqTAbq6MnZiyZZGitqV5yaKmp6aZqHqiv8elnLJlnZaxqr%2FOp2Ssm5GjsaK4jGtnam1ia4U%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
