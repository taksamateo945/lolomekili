The Gone Girl star, 36, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday, Feb. 12, and described how raising a newborn baby fits into her Hollywood life, and why she got completely naked backstage at the BAFTAs in London this past Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>"He's 9 weeks old, but I am just taking him around with me," Pike said of her son <strong>Atom</strong>, whom she and love <strong>Robie Uniacke</strong> <a href=#>welcomed this past December</a>. "It has a very interesting effect on people because they don't expect it. I'm turning up to meetings, cause what do you do? You're a mom and you got a baby who needs to eat. So I turn up and they're like, 'Oh, your baby’s here,' and I’m like, 'Yeah, yeah he is.'"</p><p>The British beauty, who had her little one waiting for her backstage while she filmed her interview with <strong><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong>, went on to add that there are few places where Atom doesn't come along.&nbsp;</p><p>Atom, whose big brother is Pike and Uniacke's eldest son <strong>Solo</strong>, 2, has even been rubbing shoulders with big-name stars at Hollywood fêtes in recent weeks.</p><p>"I do have help on the night of the award shows," Pike explained. "It's a whole operation. It's a funny kind of rock and roll. I do the red carpet — I get there really early. I'm the sort of really uncool one who turns up very early for carpet — first time I’ve never been early for anything in my life, right? And then I disappear off and I set up a sort of station backstage somewhere."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It started off very organized… I’d bring a robe and I'd bring all the kind of gear and I'd change into slippers," continued the rising star, who nabbed nominations for the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and SAGs for her chilling performance as Amy Dunne opposite <strong><a href=#>Ben Affleck</a></strong> in Gone Girl. "At the BAFTAs on Sunday night, I was like 'Oh, sod it,' and I just [went] up into the chairman of the Royal Opera House's office and just tried to put on the robe and it just wasn’t… I couldn’t do the buttons, and whipped it off."&nbsp;</p><p>"I was just sitting there butt-naked with the double breast pump," she added, cracking up as she recalled the scene. "If this guy had seen the kind of scene it was as underhand as if we’d been taking drugs or something. But it was the most innocent, pure kind of [thing]."&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Pike recount the moment in the video above and find out her plans for the photos of her illicit office trip!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmoq5Giwq%2BwjKmgpJ1dnLy1ec2aop6cXZeupLfSrZignV2WwW7Ax55km5mWqa60edOoZJuqlZbAtbLEnptmoJWneqOtwbJka2hhan5zfg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
