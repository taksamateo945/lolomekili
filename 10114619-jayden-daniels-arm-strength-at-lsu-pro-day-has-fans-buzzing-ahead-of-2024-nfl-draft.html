The LSU star is in competition with North Carolina's Drake Maye and Michigan's J.J. McCarthy to be the second quarterback taken behind USC's Caleb Williams.</p><p>There were a few long throws where Daniels was seemingly determined to increase his velocity on passes, but, for the most part, he showed scouts everything that flashes on film. Daniels is a fluid downfield passer who can hit big playmakers in stride and on the move.</p><p>Daniels did not lack for confidence in a post-workout interview with NFL Network:</p>NFL <span class=acct>@NFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"My resume speaks for itself."&lt;br>&lt;br>QB Jayden Daniels joined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CameronWolfe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CameronWolfe&lt;/a> after throwing at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LSUfootball?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LSUFootball&lt;/a>'s Pro Day.&lt;br>&lt;br>Catch the re-air tonight 8pm ET on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nflnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NFLNetwork&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/SHCKPAkTiF">https://t.co/SHCKPAkTiF&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/rWyxEMh2XH">pic.twitter.com/rWyxEMh2XH&lt;/a></p><p>While Daniels did not have edge rushers bearing down on him during Wednesday's session, no teams will question his ability to break the pocket. He's by far the most athletic quarterback in this class and is a potential 1,000-yard rusher at the quarterback position.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Albert Breer</a> of <i>Sports Illustrated</i> reported the New England Patriots, who have the No. 3 overall pick, were represented by nine different personnel members Wednesday. The Patriots are expected to take a quarterback at No. 3 if they don't trade back.</p><p>The Chicago Bears and Washington Commanders also had representatives in attendance. Washington is likely Daniels' peak drafting position at No. 2 overall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmDcoWMo5iynJWjeqWtzaKcpatdlr%2BuedKtqZ6ml6m1bq3TZqOsrV2lv7B5w5qwZqCRqHqnrc2sZJutqq%2B2r7OMmp%2BemZRivKd5kWlpbWWem7lusNGana0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
