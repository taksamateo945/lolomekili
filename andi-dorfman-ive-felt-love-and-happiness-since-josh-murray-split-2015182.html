"But I am alive. I am standing."</p><p>"Not alone, but surrounded by every stranger's kind word. By every immeasurable ounce of love from family and friends," the 27-year-old continued. "I have searched for the words to express my gratitude but can't seem to find them. So I will just two two…THANK YOU."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former Atlanta Assistant District Attorney and Murray, 30, called off their five-month engagement last month. Earlier this week, she opened up about the couple's decision in a sit-down interview with <a href=#>Bachelor host <strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a> on a special that aired this past Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>"[There was] nothing official before that, obviously to make the decision to end the engagement doesn't just happen overnight. We had struggled for a while — we definitely did," she tearfully said, noting that the breakup has been the biggest failure of her life. "We were both very aware of the fact that we just didn't better each other. I didn't feel supported and empowered, and I don't think I gave him the support and empowerment that he needed."</p><p>"I'll always love him, like I've never loved anybody like that in my life," she added of the former baseball player. "That was my first true love, without a doubt."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJinnJlisbC%2BxaaYp2WZq7JussSlq2akn6uybq3NnWShmaCltq%2Bx0qxkrKGemLJuts6sn2alpae%2FosWMrKeloaRif3F9lGpvaw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
