[Seal, 52] was never your typical dad who left for work in the morning with his briefcase and would be home by dinnertime every night. He traveled a lot. The kids knew it was part of his job. I’m a mom and a dad at the same time.”</p><p>The supermodel and “Kiss From a Rose” singer — who married in May 2005 and and share four children — announced they were separating in January 2012.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=610 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Heidi Klum redbook blue outfit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal, and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate,” they told <strong>Us</strong> in a joint statement at the time. “We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart. This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.”</p><p>Two years later in October 2014, the stars finalized their divorce. Klum, meanwhile, told Redbook how she’s been able to balance her crazy life as a single mom.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=624 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Heidi Klum redbook orange outfit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Women are capable of juggling a lot of balls — we do things that guys just cannot do,” she mused. “Men typically can juggle only one ball, and even then they’re like, ‘I’m confused. Should I put it in my right or left hand?’ A lot of them have a very hard time just trying to figure out what to do with that one ball. And often they want us to hold that one too!”</p><p>Despite her hectic lifestyle, Klum said she loves every part about herself — aging, included. “Would it be nice if my skin and body still looked the way it did when I was 25? Sure,” she speculated in her latest interview. “But the fact is, your body changes when you have children; you get wrinkles as you get older. I like that I have laugh lines from smiling too much.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=645 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Heidi Klum redbook cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BeoZSeeqy41KZkqKZdobansYyana2domLApq3LZpuirp%2BnsKZ5yKZkmmWdpLpurc2dZJpllJaxbn6PamxqbGFl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
