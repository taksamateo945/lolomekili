She was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, precisely at Valley Hospital Medical Center. A Vegas native, Jaz is obviously an American by nationality, but she is from a mixed ethnic background.</p><p>Jaz was born into one of the most famous tennis families in the US; her dad <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Andre Agassi</a> needs no introduction to the world of sports as he became a professional tennis player at the age of 16. He played at La Quinta, California, and has won several prestigious tournaments in the course of his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/Jaz-Elle-Agassi-feature-image.-1583284546026-e1675189518907.jpg><p>The youngster’s mum <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Steffi Graf</a>, on the other hand, is of German roots. Just like her husband, Steffi played tennis at a professional level, winning a total of 22 Grand Slam singles titles during the peak of her career. For 377 Weeks, Steffi ranked World No.1.</p><p>Far from being the only child of her parents, Jaz Elle Agassi built childhood memories with a brother who goes by the name Jaden Gil Agassi. Born on the 26th of October 2001, Jaden is a couple of years older than Jaz. He is pursuing a career path in baseball.</p><p>Nothing is known about Jaz’s academic pursuit, but reports said she is done with high school and may have entered college.</p><h2><strong>What Does Andre Agassi’s Daughter Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Jaz is yet to take to any career path; however, during her younger days, the American celebrity kid was interested in horse jumping and competed at a professional level. After eluding a serious accident, Andre Agassi’s only daughter gave up the sport and now rides for enjoyment. According to Jaz’s mum, she is currently focusing on hip-hop dance.</p><h3><strong>Does Jaz Elle Agassi Play Tennis?</strong></h3><p>Talking about her only daughter, Steffi Graf said Jaz made a conscious attempt to master tennis during her formative years. However, like her brother, she didn’t excel in it. To date, she has not shown any further interest in resuming from where she stopped.</p><h2><strong>Jaz Elle Agassi’s Parents Met in the Line of Duty</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/andre-agassi-and-wife-steffi-graf-e1675190211471.jpg><p>Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf first crossed paths at a tennis tournament. According to Andre, he had been Steffi’s secret admirer since 1990 but had never earned her attention as she was then dating racing driver Michael Bartels.</p><p>At Wimbledon in 1992, Jaz Elle Agassi’s parents both emerged winners of the singles event but were not allowed to dance together. Five years down the line, in 1997, Andre wedded model cum actress Brooke Shields, but they divorced in 1999. The same year, luck shined on Andre as he finally got Steffi’s attention, and they started going steady following the French Open of 1999.</p><p>The couple eventually tied the knot on the 22nd of October 2001 in a private ceremony with only their mothers present. The couple’s union was already two years old when they had Jaz. Andre and Steffi’s union has endured for over two decades and still going strong. The duo still reside in Vegas, where they raised their children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmaZnpm%2FpnnAoJisq5moeqWt1KCfrZ2iYreixoyeo6WdXZa0or%2FSomY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
