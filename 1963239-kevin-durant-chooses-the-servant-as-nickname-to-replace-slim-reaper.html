You can call him "The Servant" instead.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: Wednesday, Feb. 19, at 2:20 p.m. ET&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Just kidding. Don't call Durant The Servant. Per&nbsp;The Oklahoman's Anthony Slater, Durant was being facetious:</p><p>Or, you know, continue to call him Slim Reaper against his wishes. Whatever works.</p><p>---End of update---</p><p>"You can call me, 'The Servant,'" he answered, to Simmons' amazement.</p><p>The Servant? Really? That's hardly as catchy as Slim Reaper, which is easily one of the most underrated nicknames in all of the <a href=#>NBA</a>. It's also one Durant has consistently attempted to distance himself from.</p><p>"I’m here to shine a bright light," Durant said previously, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Oklahoman's Darnell Mayberry</a>. "I’m not here to be a guy of, I guess, death. I just like KD better."</p><p>Realizing Slim Reaper chatter just won't die, it seems Durant has attempted to nickname himself, or as such an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">act is known as</a>, "Dwyane Wade-ing." But while The Servant is better than "W.o.W.," that's not saying much. What appellation isn't?</p><p>Pressed for an explanation as to why we should call Durant The Servant, the wiry forward eventually relented.</p><p>"I just like to serve everybody," Durant told Simmons. "My teammates, ushers at the game, fans."</p><p>"I thought of that last night," he added.</p><p>Keep thinking, Slim Reaper. Or KD.&nbsp;</p><p>While accurate—in that Durant truly does play for everyone, from his <a href=#>Oklahoma City Thunder</a> teammates to his fans—it's just not catchy, and handles need to be catchy. Not to mention, he seemingly despises Slim Reaper because of how depressing it is, and The Servant isn't any more uplifting.</p><p>"I seen the picture," Durant said of the Slim Reaper nickname. "It was pretty cool, but it looked a little too dark for me."</p><p>Simmons revealed that Jalen Rose was trying to get "Iceberg Slim" going for Durant despite meeting objections. Although Iceberg Slim is hardly perfect, it's better than The Servant. Way better.</p><p>For that matter, so is Slim Reaper, KD and The Durantula. And so are completely made-up suggestions like "Beanstalk Bandit," "Lanky Liquidator," "Twiggy Torpedo," "Lean, Mean Scoring Title Machine" and "Slender Slayer," all of which are awful and corny but keep in theme with the spirit of bynames.</p><p>If Durant is that against Slim Reaper, then he's free to change it. Next time, though, a bit more creativity would go a long way in helping him shed the dreaded, albeit completely accurate and absolutely fetching, sobriquet he no longer wishes to call his own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaHJuY2eAennKnq2ipl2ZwrOtza1knKCfpMCmv4ytn55lo5q%2Ft63NrWSaq12jtqS3zZqknmWkpHqzsc%2BlmJydXai5qrmMq5yaqJWn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
