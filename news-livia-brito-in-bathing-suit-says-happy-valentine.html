Read on to see 7 ways Livia Brito stays in shape and the photos that prove they workâ€”and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic</span></a><span>: "If you're planning to start an exercise program and wondering where to begin, start with your core first, says physical therapist Brittany Smith, DPT. People often think of the core muscles as being the abdominal muscles, but the core includes the muscles in the abdomen, back and hips, all working together as a group." "The core muscles provide stability for the entire body as it moves," says Smith. "These muscles are activated when you stand up, turn, bend, reach, twist, stoop and move in most other ways. Everything starts with your core."</span></p><p><span>Livia has been seen in YouTube videos at the gym. Good call. "Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>. "Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-869216518.jpg><p><span>"Aloe is a cactus-like plant that grows in hot, dry climates. It is cultivated in subtropical regions around the world, including the southern border areas of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California," says the NIH. "Clinical research suggests that topical application of an aloe-based gel twice daily (along with medical soap and tretinoin gel) may improve acne."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-958575320.jpg><p><span>In her gym videos, Livia works out each muscle group individually. "Warm up with five to 10 minutes of stretching or brisk walking. Then choose a weight or resistance level heavy enough to tire your muscles after 12 to 15 repetitions," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>. "With the proper weight, a single set of 12 to 15 repetitions can build muscle efficiently in most people and can be as effective as multiple sets of the same exercise."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1236656275.jpg><p><span>Livia says salmon is a go-to protein, and egg whites. "Because our bodies can't produce </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>omega-3 fatty acids</span></a><span> by itself, it is an essential nutrient we need. Omega-3 fatty acids are a class of polyunsaturated fats, which are great for heart health, eye health, brain health, hormone production, immune function, and heart and lung support. A typical </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>3 oz. fillet of salmon</span></a><span> will give you almost 2.2 grams (2198 milligrams) of omega-3 fatty acids. This gives you a sufficient amount of omega-3 fatty acids you need in a day because the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>recommended daily intake</span></a><span> (RDI) is around 250 to 500 milligrams for an average person," says our sister site </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Eat This, Not That!</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpaGmnq5urtGiq6hlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKyYsqtdna6xvNhmrZqklaPBqrrEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
