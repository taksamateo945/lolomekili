Added his wife, Miller, “But we’re very happy with the end of season 7.”</p><p></p><p>The season finale, which airs on Monday, May 11, could have been the show’s last episode ever, and if that was the case, Marlowe and Miller wanted the longtime fans to be pleased with where their favorite characters end up.&nbsp;</p><p>“In most seasons in the past, we were aware whether or not we were coming back, and so we were able to structure really fun, engaging cliffhangers,” Marlowe explained. “But this season we knew there was a chance that the show might not return. And given that, we wanted to make sure that the fans had some sense of resolution and some sense of good feelings about the characters, so we’re really satisfied with where we leave off if this is the last show, and if it’s not the last show, we’re really excited about the storytelling possibilities where we end up and where Castle and Beckett go as a couple.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Next week’s finale will center around a traumatic childhood event that led Richard Castle to become a famous mystery novelist. It won’t touch on Castle’s time away from Beckett following their wedding gone wrong. That’s a plot point the writers hope to rehash in season 8.&nbsp;</p><p>Other possible topics for the new season of Castle now that the show has been renewed: More trouble from Senator Bracken — the man responsible for Johanna Beckett’s murder.&nbsp;</p><p>“We think that there’s some storytelling opportunity with Senator Bracken, who’s currently behind bars,” Marlowe says. “But we know that he has lots of friends and allies out there. A lot of that has been laid to rest, but when you make an enemy that is that formidable, they reemerge, and they reemerge stronger and in unexpected ways.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>One villain who isn’t likely coming back is the terrifying serial killer 3XK, whom Castle finally bested this season.&nbsp;</p><p>“He is a pretty crafty guy, but I’m not sure how we would write ourselves out of that dilemma of resurrecting him when we have a body and we saw him get shot,” Marlowe said, laughing.&nbsp;</p><p>“And I do think the way that Castle triumphs over 3XK is really satisfying,” Miller added. “For me personally, to look at it from a fan’s point of view, watching that episode, I just felt so strongly about that moment. I think that’s one you really can’t top, because Castle really outsmarted a super villain.”</p><p>With star Katic’s contract still unsigned, many fans are speculating the possibility of the beloved detective being killed off. But Marlowe and Miller quickly put to rest that notion.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I think for us that’s off the table. For us we’ve been telling a love story for the last seven years,” Marlowe explained, with Miller adding, “I think that would be a huge betrayal of our fans.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>So if Beckett’s safe, where will the dynamic duo be 10 years down the line?</p><p>“We see them together and enjoying life and enjoying adventures,” Miller said. “And I would be interested to find out if the time traveler was right about the things he said, if he truly was a time traveler,” she added, referencing the season 6 episode “Time Will Tell.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Do you think Castle should kill off Kate Beckett before season 8?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOnJisrJyaerS0zrBknKqVlsGwvtJmm6KrmGK8r3nSnpisp55ihW63yKWjoqaXYriiwMRmmZ6bm5rBtXmRaWhucGU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
