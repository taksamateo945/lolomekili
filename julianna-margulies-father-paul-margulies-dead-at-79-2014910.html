The Emmy winner's dad passed away at the age of 79 on Oct. 7. In his obituary, posted by <a href=#>The Berkshire Eagle</a>, Paul is said to be "remembered for his never ending friendship, his spectacular sense of humor and joke telling, and his kindness to all who met him."</p>&nbsp;<p>Noted as a "tremendous leader in the Anthroposophical community," Julianna's dad is also known for composing the famous jingle for Alka-Seltzer with the lyrics, "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is."&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Huffington Post</a> in 2013, Julianna said her dad would often offer his opinion on The Good Wife's story line. "My dad, who's such a fan of the show, he called me last week and said, 'I don't like where the show's going. It's too dark. There has to be a human element of sympathy for these characters and I'm not feeling it.' I was like, 'Dad, hang in there. It's coming,'" she then recalled.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Julianna was last spotted out with her husband <strong>Keith Lieberthal</strong> in New York City on Oct. 4.</p><p>Paul is survived by his wife <strong>Victoria</strong>, his three daughters <strong>Alexandra</strong>, <strong>Rachel</strong> and Julianna, his brother <strong>Michael</strong>, his sister-in-law <strong>Judy Margulies</strong>, and his five grandchildren.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGupJmWu6%2BtjKaYq5%2Blobamv4yfmK2glad6sa3UpWSmmaKcwq21xKxknZ2RmXqiwIxwcGZqYGaBen2P</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
