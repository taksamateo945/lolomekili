Eight years later, he is appearing as <strong>Shane</strong> in the anticipated Netflix series Tiny Pretty Things alongside his girlfriend. But fans are still confused about the sexuality of the actor, and we are here to help cut through the confusion.</p><p>The Canadian actor <a href=#>was born on</a> 20 October 1994 in Burlington, Ontario. Bullied at a young age, Brennan found comfort in dancing and later made it his passion training at different studios in Ontario. After finishing high school, Brennan wanted to study medicine at University but a talk from his dance teacher meant he auditioned and later got into the Juilliard School.</p><p>Brennan graduated from the Juilliard School in 2016 and continued on a career as a dancer. While he had been in movies and TV shows before, Brennan Clost's first major role came in The Next Step. But his biggest appearance will be in Tiny Pretty Things as Shane alongside his girlfriend.</p><h2>Brennan Clost Girlfriend - Who is the Actor Dating?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2020/12/brennan-clost-girlfriend-2021.jpg alt=brennan-clost-girlfriend-2021 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Brennan Clost is currently in a relationship with his girlfriend Casimere Jollette, while some fans he is gay.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Brennan Clost Instagram</a></strong></p><p>Brennan Clost was hired to appear in the Netflix series Tiny Pretty Things in 2019.

In the caption of his TikTok video that actor wrote, "I don't label myself, so don't label me pls. The only thing I know for sure is I'm not straight." We were going to say the actor was bisexual but since he does not want any labels, let's stick with "not straight" as his sexuality.</p><h2>Brennan Clost Plays Shane in the Netflix Series Tiny Pretty Things</h2><p></p><p>Tiny Pretty Things is about the cutthroat world of elite ballet dancing school where students will do anything to get ahead.
