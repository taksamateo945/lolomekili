The 2008 DreamWorks film about a huge panda who is destined for martial arts fame has been seen again and again by many streamers who have their accounts locked down. Three full-length sequels to Kung Fu Panda have been produced since the original movie’s debut.</p><p>Po, the main character in Kung Fu Panda who is a <a href=# rel=noopener>fat cartoon Panda</a>, fantasises about being one of the kung fu experts known as “The Furious Five.” He resides with Mr. Ping, his adoptive father, who believes the panda will eventually take over his noodle shop. Po is able to propel himself into an arena during a competition to find the rumoured “Dragon Warrior” who will bring peace to the valley, where Grand Master Oogway recognises him as a kung fu saviour. Po has a lot to learn, The Furious Five and their instructor Shifu understand after that. Kung Fu Panda, which cost $130 million to produce, made over $630 million at the box office and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature.</p><p>There are a tonne of A-list celebs in the Kung Fu Panda cast, many of them have distinctive and memorable voices. An American actor plays the primary character Po, who immediately sets the humorous tone and keeps a goofy energy throughout the entire film. The Kung Fu Panda core cast has actors and actresses who provide generally balanced performances as elder figures who instruct their proteges, in contrast to the central protagonist. There is a lot to admire in the DreamWorks movie, with so many distinctive characters and well-known actors. Here is a list of every character in Kung Fu Panda.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Angelina Jolie As Tigress</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Dan Fogler As Zeng</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> David Cross As Crane</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Dustin Hoffman As Shifu</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Ian McShane As Tai Lung</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Jack Black As Po</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Jackie Chan As Monkey</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> James Hong As Mr. Ping</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Lucy Liu As Viper</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Michael Clarke Duncan As Commander Vachir</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> Randall Duk Kim As Oogway</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> Seth Rogen As Mantis</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> The Rest Of The Kung Fu Panda Voice Cast</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Angelina_Jolie_As_Tigress>Angelina Jolie As Tigress<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Angelina-Jolie-As-Tigress-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Tigress, the head of The Furious Five and a South China tiger, is portrayed by American actress Angelina Jolie.</p><p>Jolie is most recognised for playing the lead roles in the Lara Croft and Maleficent movie series.
