And while dinner and a movie could do the trick, why not kick things up a notch and really impress your significant other with a night to remember? To help you out, we talked to couples counselors, therapists, and other experts to round up some inventive, unforgettable, and unique <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/creative-valentines-day-ideas/ data-target=_blank data-rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentine's Day ideas</span>. So cancel your dinner reservations and take your better half for a spin on one of these romantic Valentine's Day dates instead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couple-winter-running-city.jpg><p>Take a trip down memory lane with your partner this Valentine's Day by creating a scavenger hunt for them. It can take place in your house or even in a nearby area where the two of you share fond memories. "Each 'clue' can connect to a memory about the couple," explains Massachusetts-based couples therapist <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Bri McCarroll</a></strong>. "Each clue leads to another experience the couple had, creating a 'memory lane' experience, and ideally ending with a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>romantic experience</a> or gift."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/wife-grateful-husband-cooking.jpg><p>Who says you have to spend exorbitant amounts of money at a restaurant on Valentine's Day to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>make your partner happy</a>? In a 2020 survey of more than 2,200 adults, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>eMediHealth</a> found that 41.5 percent of respondents thought that a home-cooked meal was more romantic than one at a restaurant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couples-massage.jpg><p>A couples massage is a win-win. Not only will your partner love the much-needed R&R, but you also get a massage! In eMediHealth's survey, 26 percent of both men and women said they'd love to receive a massage for Valentine's Day more than anything, so you really can't go wrong with this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Valentine's Day gift idea</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couple-rock-climbing.jpg><p>Or go-karting or axe-throwing! "A little excitement can be a great rev-up, especially as a precursor to some love-making later," says couples counselor <strong>Corrin Voeller</strong>, LMFT, owner of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Prosper Therapy</a> in Minnesota.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couple-arcade.jpg><p>When was the last time you went to the arcade? Have some old-fashioned fun this Valentine's Day by taking your date to a place where both of you have nostalgic memories. Playing arcade games will inspire "a good time with some friendly competition," says Voeller.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/black-couple-kissing-wine.jpg><p>Where did you and your significant other have <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>your first date</a>? Where did you share your first kiss? If these places are easily accessible, plan a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Valentine's Day date</a> around visiting them, suggests couples therapist <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Heather Lyons</a></strong>, PhD. "People like to feel seen and appreciated," she explains. "Valentine's Day is a great opportunity to show your partner how well you know them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couple-exploring-city.jpg><p>"We rarely get to see our hometowns from the point of view of a visitor," says dating coach <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Damona Hoffman</a></strong>, host and producer of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Dates & Mates Show</a>. "As corny as tours can be, you and your significant other can have a blast seeing the city through new eyes—and it might cause you to look at your relationship from a new perspective, too."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/latinx-couple-volunteering.jpg><p>This year, turn your <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Valentine's Day date</a> into a more philanthropic effort by giving back to the community. "Volunteering together can help you make others feel good, while also feeding your own soul," notes Hoffman. "Sharing love in any form is what Valentine's Day is all about."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couple-snacks-chess.jpg><p>Having a game night will inspire laughs, love, and friendly competition. "Some of my fondest date memories are playing board games or video games with my husband," Hoffman says. She suggests spicier games like Truth or Dare or Never Have I Ever for a Valentine's Day to remember.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couple-dressed-up-show.jpg><p>Instead of seeing a movie like many couples do on Valentine's Day, consider getting tickets to a live show instead. Hoffman notes that this will not only switch things up, but also "win [you] major points for culture and creativity."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couple-pottery-class.jpg><p>Many towns and cities have studios now that offer couples art classes. And they're the perfect way to spend Valentine's Day, providing both an experience and a gift. "If you can't afford the studio, you can easily create a version of this date in your backyard," says Hoffman. "Just get some supplies at an art store and let yourselves play."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/cooking-class.jpg><p>Instead of going to a restaurant this Valentine's Day, consider learning how to cook a meal with the person you love most. "Amateur cooking classes have been springing up all over the place. Learning and creating something together can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>do wonders for intimacy</a>," says Hoffman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/shutterstock_529653325.jpg><p>If you're up for doing something spontaneous this Valentine's Day, <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Ashley Campana</a></strong>, director of recruitment at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Lisa Clampitt Matchmaking</a>, suggests going on a last-minute getaway. "Find a hotel within driving distance, go there, and check out the local attractions," Campana suggests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/couple-bookstore.jpg><p>Don't have the time or money to get away? No problem! Instead of traveling, "go to the travel section of your library or bookstore and start planning your next trip," says Campana. This is a fun way to daydream and fantasize with your partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/couple-museum.jpg><p>If you know that your partner enjoys art and history, then use Valentine's Day as an excuse to bring them on a museum date. Checking out a local museum is relaxing, inexpensive, and gives you an excuse to hold hands while you stroll around and take all the exhibits in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/lesbian-couple-cuddling-couch.jpg><p>Watching romantic movies on Valentine's Day is so cliché. Instead, <strong>Celia Schweyer</strong>, dating expert at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>DatingRelationshipsAdvice.com</a>, suggests having a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>horror movie marathon</a>. "Movies of this genre are infamous for being the ones where you snuggle up to your partner," she notes. "Physical intimacy increases in dire moments—and there are a lot!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/couple-looking-at-album.jpg><p>At its core, Valentine's Day is about love. And <strong>Sara Stanisz</strong>, founder of couples lifestyle blog <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Our Kind of Crazy</a>, says that the best way to celebrate that love is by "looking back on your year together." How do you do this? By creating a photo book of your relationship!</p><p>"There are some great sites online that can put a book together for you quickly and easily, and all you have to do is upload your photos and arrange the pages the way you want," Stanisz says. "This is a great Valentine's Day tradition to start."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/selfie-couple-sporting-event.jpg><p>Even if you aren't the biggest basketball or hockey fan, the energetic atmosphere of a sporting event can make your Valentine's Day fun and lively. "Who knows—maybe you will even make it on the Valentine's Day special love jumbotron," says <strong>April Davis</strong>, professional matchmaker and owner of matchmaking service <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Luma</a>.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/middle-age-couple-shopping.jpg><p>"Instead of buying Valentine's Day presents in advance, go to a store together and give each other a price and time limit. Split up and scramble around the shop looking for goodies to present to each other. This is a fun date idea that doesn't take itself too seriously and is sure to add lightheartedness and less pressure to the gift-giving process," says Davis. "After, grab some dinner while you share your presents and open them in front of one another."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/phone-wine-woman.jpg><p>Valentine's Day can be hard for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>people in long distance relationships</a>, but there are ways to celebrate the day together if you get a bit creative. "Making time to sit down and have that 'virtual dinner date' is always a good idea," says Schweyer. "You can binge-watch your favorite movies together or play a game that the two of you will enjoy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmr5mcmru1tc2eqmacka56qrDEmqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
