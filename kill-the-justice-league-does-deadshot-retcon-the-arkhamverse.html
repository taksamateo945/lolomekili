We’ve seen it happen before in the great <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">history of recasting/redesigning</a>, and it often goes by without a narrative explanation.</p><p>The funny thing here, though, is that some fans believe that Rocksteady is trying to offer a narrative explanation for this character swap via this somewhat mysterious tweet:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>That tweet seems to be an early, somewhat loose, attempt to address the different character designs, though there’s a bit of a debate regarding what it all means. The most popular theory at the moment is that the text of that tweet suggests that the “old” Deadshot was an imposter who the “real” Deadshot killed and replaced. Some are also arguing that the <strong>Kill the Justice League</strong> Deadshot may just be a capable assassin trying to claim the Deadshot title, but the fact that the photo above reveals (or strongly suggests) that this Deadshot’s real name is also Floyd Lawton would, at the very least, make that a much more complicated theory to argue for.</p><p>Even <strong>Kill the Justice League</strong>‘s Deadshot being portrayed as a former Arkham inmate raises questions. The assumption is that this character may have been sent to <strong>Arkham</strong> for killing the other Deadshot, but given that the fate of Arkham Asylum itself following the events of <strong>Arkham City</strong> and <strong>Arkham Knight</strong> remains debatable and given that we don’t know what the possibility of a “real” and “fake” Deadshot means for Waller’s initial recruitment of Deadshot…well, the point is that this “imposter” possibility raises a lot of questions.</p><p>So is Rocksteady trying to retcon the Arkhamverse? Well, we’ll have to wait to learn the specifics of this character swap (if we ever learn them at all), but given what Rocksteady has revealed so far, it certainly seems like they’re trying to suggest that the old Deadshot wasn’t quite who we thought he was. While I can’t seem to find any evidence in the previous games that strongly hinted at that idea, I’m curious if anyone will uncover evidence in those games that does help lay the groundwork for the “imposter” theory.</p><p>If Rocksteady had chosen (or still chooses to) change the Deadshot character model without a narrative explanation, then there certainly would have been some fans who would have found a reason to complain about that decision. However, I’d have to imagine that most people would have just assumed it was done due to some kind of internal creative preference and would have eventually moved on. By suggesting that there is a narrative reason behind that swap, though, they’re really opening the door to the possibility they could play with the Arkhamverse lore quite a bit. That’s hardly a new idea (continuity in comic book stories is often altered in far more crazy ways), but it does further complicate what was already a somewhat confusing relationship between the <strong>Arkham</strong> games and <strong>Kill the Justice League</strong> (as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming <strong>Gotham Knights</strong></a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOpKClpF2ptaZ5ya6qraGTmnqtscCgrJ5llKSytHnDnpidq5ikwW6%2BxK2aqKZdqbWmecCroqGZnauys7%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
