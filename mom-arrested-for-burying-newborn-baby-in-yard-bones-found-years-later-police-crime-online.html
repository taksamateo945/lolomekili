On June 25, police officers reportedly discovered several small bones from the grave which appeared to have been there for an extended period of time.</p><p>The bones were confirmed to be that of a newborn through forensic analysis. WCWN reported that police previously said the property owners and residents where the remains were found were not involved in the baby’s death and concealment.</p><p>According to WNYT, Sawyer told police she gave birth to a stillborn baby in the spring of 2017. Instead of calling for help, Sawyer allegedly claimed she panicked and buried her baby’s remains in the yard.</p><p>Police also said they do not believe Sawyer had help from the baby’s father, who cooperated with the investigation.</p><p>Sawyer was charged with concealing a human corpse. Watervliet police said she was released from custody on her own recognizance.</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.
