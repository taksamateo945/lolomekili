This is remarkable because Peter has inclusion body Myositis (IBM), an inflammatory and degenerative muscle disease that causes painless weakening of muscle.</p><p>Frampton, although experienced some weakness and loss of function in larger muscles, his fingers still function great. His finger dexterity was not what his doctor, rheumatologist Lisa Christopher-Stine, expected to find before his first appointment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.ontrend.news/uploads/2022/5/a341471f-8b24-4b4f-9aa2-db57395bdc53.jpg><p>The doctor said she always wondered if Peter would be one of those high-maintenance, dark sunglasses-wearing celebrities. Frampton was not. She added, ” the musician didn’t have an entourage. he is just a very down-to-earth, loving, kind person.”</p><p>The British rock musician is consistently upbeat, with a can-do attitude, a great sense of humor, a kind heart, and a hearty laugh. We can say that Peter has IMB, but IBM does not have him.</p><p>Frampton stated, “Sure, I have my darker moments of life, but I have so much to be thankful for. We all have our own battles. This was meant to be mine, but everybody has something.”</p><h2 id=musician-peter-frampton-health-problems-and-sickness>Musician Peter Frampton Health Problems And Sickness</h2><p>On February 22, 2019, Peter Frampton announced that he would be retiring from touring with his farewell tour, ‘Peter Frampton-The Farewell Tour’ commencing on June 18, 2019, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, running through October 12, concluding in Concord, California.</p><p>The musician also revealed the reason behind the farewell tour, and he was diagnosed with inclusion body myositis (IBM), a progressive muscle disorder. The tour featured special guests Jason Bonham’s Led Zeppelin Evening and Peter’s son.</p><p>Each dollar of every ticket sold for the tour was donated to benefit Peter’s newly formed myositis research fund at Johns Hopkins, where he is being treated. In June 2019, his album, All Blues, featured at number one on the Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart.</p><p>In December 2019, Frampton further announced his farewell U.K. tour to consist of five performances in May 2020. However, the UK/EU was canceled in April due to COVID-19.</p><h2 id=where-is-peter-frampton-now>Where Is Peter Frampton Now?</h2><p>Peter Frampton is doing his best, establishing the Peter Frampton Myositis Research Fund at John Hopkins to raise research on the disease. IBM is pretty rare, merely affecting maybe 8 out of every 1 million Americans.</p><p>IBM has not collected enough research funding, nor has it been a big focus of drug development by pharmaceutical companies. The musician is doing his best to change this situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.ontrend.news/uploads/2022/5/48d65230-c5ee-454e-b09c-082b3ddc97ef.jpg><p>In February 2019, Peter appeared on the hit T.V. show CBS This Morning to announce the fund and his 51-date U.S. farewell tour.
