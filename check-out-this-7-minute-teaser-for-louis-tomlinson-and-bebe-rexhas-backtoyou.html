He’s been giving interviews, taking part in photo shoots, and sharing pieces of his new song ‘Back To You’ with Bebe Rexha and Digital Farm Animals for weeks now.</p><p>Now, with less than 24 hours until the songs bud debut, in fact, some countries can already listen to the tune via Spotify, this video appeared on his website. It’s a teaser so we were expecting, at best, a compilation of the videos he’d been posting on Instagram but we ended up with much more than that.</p><p></p><p>Yes, that is a 7 minute teaser for ‘Back To you’ and Louis looks absolutely stunning in the video. He also announces, in unique ways, that the song and video are out tomorrow via his sweater and the radio in his car towards the end of the teaser. While he’s not giving anything away lyrically, we love the beat to the song and the way it’s almost hypnotizing. This is definitely going to be one of those songs that will get stuck in your head, and you’ll enjoy it the entire time.</p><p>The song will undoubtedly be a massive success and we can’t wait to see what’s next for Louis and Bebe both together and individually. We’re hoping for some live performances together soon and some behind the scenes looks into the making of ‘Back To You’ as well.</p><p>What do you hope to see from Louis and Bebe? Have you heard the song yourselves yet and if not – what is your favorite part of the teaser? Let us know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksKmxwqRkqK2kYsGptdJmbmalmaPCtbGMrZyaq5Wneqe70WajqK2ZqHq1u8yloKern6N6orrDZpmempViv6bEx5qqZpqRmLi1u9iorGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
