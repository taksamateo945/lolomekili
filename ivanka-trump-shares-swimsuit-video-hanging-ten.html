Trump, 41, shared pictures and video of herself wake surfing at Miami Beach in a yellow swimsuit and black hat, getting the attention of singer Jewel, who commented on the social media post. "So smooth!" the singer said. How does the former First Daughter stay so fit? Here are 5 ways Trump is living her best life.</span></p><p><span>Trump focused on eating a healthy diet to bounce back after having children. "I find that in the absence of exercise, I have to be more mindful about what I eat and my diet, especially now that I just had a baby and trying to sort of get back to where I was before Theodore was born," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "So I'm being not perfect but definitely more cognizant than I normally am about the foods that I'm consuming. For me, at the end of the day, exercise is more about how I physically feel and it's giving me clarity of mind and diet has more of a direct impact on my actual weight."</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-1245221749.jpg><p><span>Trump enjoys running as a way to get exercise while spending quality time with her husband. "I like to run with my husband [Jared Kushner]," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "It's something we started doing around a year and a half ago when my team at my fashion brand all decided collectively we would train for a half marathon. I had never run like a half mile in my life, so this was a very daunting experience. But in addition to having an amazing time with the incredible women that work for me, I also picked up a running bug — like I really actually rather enjoy it. So I go out with my husband every Saturday morning, we'll run for an hour and we'll just chat. It's an amazing time for the two of us as well."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-1282573973.jpg><p><span>Trump swears by lemon water and regular massages to feel and look her best. "It's so important to stay hydrated while traveling," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "It's an easy hack, but drinking lots of water really helps you to stay glowing and energized during long trips. When I can, I drink lemon with my water—it dresses it up a little bit! As a working mother of three, it's not often I get to enjoy a spa treatment, but when I do, I love a classic deep tissue massage. This is especially helpful right now, as my neck and back are always sore from carrying around my two toddlers and infant son."</span></p><p><span>Trump enjoys cooking at home for her family. "Until I got married, the only pieces of cookware I owned were a couple of pots and a George Foreman grill from college," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Now, every Friday night, I spend three hours making a feast—including two entrées, like veal Marsala and spinach kugel. It's basically Thanksgiving once a week, complete with leftovers for the weekend."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/Ivanka.Trump_.png><p><span>Trump allows herself indulgences when she feels like it. "Thanks to my Czech-German heritage, I can't get enough of savory foods like stews, sausage, noodles, and anything that involves melted cheese," she says. "Not great choices from a dietary perspective, but at the end of a long day I feel like I'm entitled."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKrCwKeimmWkp8KuvIysn5qqlah6tMPIpqquoaRiw6qwxKhkoZmenLavs4ytnKdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
